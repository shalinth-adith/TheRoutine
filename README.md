## What I Learned

- Building scalable SwiftUI views using `NavigationStack`
- Managing shared state with `@State`, `@Observable`, `@Binding`
- Presenting modal forms using `.sheet`
- Working with `Codable` and `UserDefaults` for local persistence
- Handling dates using `Calendar` to limit one completion per day
- Calculating streaks from sorted `[Date]` arrays
- Dynamic UI based on data (e.g., color badges, disabled buttons)

## Tech Stack

- Swift 5.9+
- SwiftUI
- Xcode 15+
- iOS 17 SDK

---

## Future Improvements

-  Local notifications/reminders for habits
-  Add bar/line chart for visual progress
-  Habit categories (Health, Learning, etc.)
-  Sync using iCloud with `CoreData`
-  FaceID/Passcode lock for privacy
